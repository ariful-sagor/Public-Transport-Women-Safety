The systematic approach to technology decisions and meticulous considerations in system design underscores a belief in technology's power to enhance safety. The assembly platform, a well-thought-out Vero board, hosts components strategically, including the ESP8266 microcontroller, GPS module, buzzer, Li-ion battery, toggle switch, and push button, ensuring seamless integration. Noteworthy is the GPS module's communication with the ESP8266 microcontroller, optimizing signal reception with an integrated GPS antenna. Coding for the microcontroller was vital, leading to thorough testing for flawless real-world functionality. Leveraging Blynk, an IoT platform, and integrating the U-Blox NEO 6M GPS module proved crucial for secure communication, real-time control, and enhancing user experience in live location tracking projects.
